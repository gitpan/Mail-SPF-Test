# Legend:
# --- = A new release
#   + = Added a feature (in a backwards compatible way)
#   ! = Changed something significant, or removed a feature
#   * = Fixed a bug, or made a minor improvement

--- 1.001 (2007-05-30 20:30)

  Miscellaneous:
  ! Build-require Module::Build 0.2805 (was: 0.26), hopefully fixing a
    version.pm/CPAN.pm compatibility issue (see rt.cpan.org #26784).
    (Debian packaging is not affected because it does not rely on META.yml.)
  * Require YAML.pm >= 0.50 (was unversioned), as the required OO
    infrastructure was introduced only then.

  Debian:
  * Depends: libyaml-perl (>= 0.50) (was unversioned)

--- 1.000 (initial release) (2006-12-23 20:00)
